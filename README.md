# shdw

_shdw_ is a dot files setup for managing multiple shadow users on a single user account.  
It has "batteries included" plugins for vim, a well-tuned tmux config file, and intelligent handling of git users.

## Features

- All vim plugins are included in the repository, so no additional setup is necessary
- Bash is setup in vim mode by default, and readline has `jk` mapped to `<esc>`
- Git is aliased to use the shadow user's name and email in all commits.
